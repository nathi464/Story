The previous edition of this book had three appendixes. This edition retains the first two appendixes.
I have updated Appendix B to cover new Javadoc features in JDK 9. In the previous edition, Appendix C
covered compact profiles, which were introduced in JDK 8. Now you can create a custom runtime image in
JDK 9, which makes compact profiles kind of redundant. This made me drop Appendix C in this edition.
I cover creating custom runtime uimages in JDK 9 in the third volume of this series.
I received several emails from the readers about the fact that the books in this series do not include
questions and exercises, which are needed mainly for students and beginners. Students use this book in
their Java classes as a Java text book and many beginners use it to learn Java.
