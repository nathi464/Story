The Lord is my Sherpard.Yes, He is.

The previous edition of this book had three appendixes. This edition retains the first two appendixes.
I have updated Appendix B to cover new Javadoc features in JDK 9. In the previous edition, Appendix C
covered compact profiles, which were introduced in JDK 8. Now you can create a custom runtime image in
JDK 9, which makes compact profiles kind of redundant. This made me drop Appendix C in this edition.

There are versions of Python for many platforms. 
The book uses the Idle code editor which is included with the Python distribution.
It doesn't matter
